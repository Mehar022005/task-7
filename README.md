Task 7 - Support Vector Machines (SVM)
Objective
To implement Support Vector Machines (SVMs) for both linear and non-linear classification using the Breast Cancer Dataset.

Tools Used
Python
Scikit-learn
NumPy
Matplotlib
Dataset
Used the Breast Cancer dataset provided. Preprocessing included:

Dropping ID column
Mapping 'diagnosis' to binary (M=1, B=0)
Standardizing features


Methodology
Loaded and prepared the dataset for binary classification.
Trained Linear SVM and RBF SVM models.
Tuned RBF model with default parameters.
Visualized results with PCA.
Evaluated using accuracy score.


Results
Linear SVM and RBF SVM both performed well.
Accuracy printed in console.
Decision boundaries plotted using PCA projection.

Key Learnings
Margin Maximization
Kernel Trick
Hyperparameter Tuning
